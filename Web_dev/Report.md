## Initial Plan

For this assignment we have been asked to create a note taking application with server-side integration in order to save notes. This will have to be a user-friendly application so I will concentrate a lot on the design to make it usable and attractive.

### Features

With this web page I would like to impliment the following features.

The user should be able to:

- Create and Store new notes.
- Delete old notes.
- Download notes.

Different note styles will be available to cater for different preferences.
Different fonts will also be available.
